## ALTester

### ALTester has a default constructor which initializes a new object ArrayList with 23 indices that can only contain integer elements. Once initialized, each index is assigned a randomly generated value. Then, it uses checkSort() to confirm whether or not the array's elements are arranged in ascending order, the result of which is displayed as a part of a string message in the main method. If it's not sorted, class OrderedArrayList is called to sort the original ArrayList array.
