## ALTester

# ALTester has a default constructor which initializes a new object ArrayList with 23 indices that can only contain integer elements. Once initialized, it uses checkSort() to confirm whether or not the array's elements are arranged in ascending order, the result of which is displayed as a part of a string message in the end.
