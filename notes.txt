DISCO:
- Have to import java.util.ArrayList and limit the ArrayList object to only use integers.

- Imports are before class code (before class header).

- ArrayList has its own toString(), get(), remove(), and compareTo() method. 

- SYNTAX: obj = new ArrayList<Integer>(number of elements);

- You can end a void method while it is in a loop by simply doing return;

QCC:
- How could you modify this program to work with Objects other than Integer?

- How would compareTo work with Strings? Other objects?
